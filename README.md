# Investigate-a-Dataset
## About this project and Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Program
In this project, I will applied the knowledge I learned in the Data Analysis program to the basic data analyze process. The coding environment is Python(Pandas, Numpy and matplotlib). I am given the dataset of [Tmdb movie data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042115000) to look for findings in the dataset.
## How to run this project
You can download the ipynb to run it with Jupyter Notebook(don't forget to download csv sheet as well) or view as a HTML.
This project begins with data wrangling and data cleaning of setting data into desired format. In explantory data analysis, four questions are raised:<br>
1.Which genre is the most profitable over time?<br>
2.Does higher vote mean more profit?<br>
3.Discover trends of the movie industry over time.<br>
4.Compare movies with top budget with top revenue.<br>
## Findings
<li>TV and Documentation are genres with the highest profits. This could be coming from the viewers of TV channels.</li>
<li>A good movie generally sells better, but not 100%.</li>
<li>Movies are getting shorter, receieving less budget, revenue ,and less profitable. Moreover, it is getting worse a little bit in average. </li>
<li> A blockbuster sells good has better evaluation, and more profitable.</li>
