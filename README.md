# Investigate-a-Dataset
## Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Program
In this project, I will applied the knowledge I learned in the Data Analysis program to the basic data analyze process. The coding environment is Python(Pandas, Numpy and matplotlib). I am given the dataset of [Tmdb movie data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042115000) to look for findings in the dataset.
